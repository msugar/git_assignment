a. What is an issue?

	Use GitHub Issues to track ideas, feedback, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub.

	GitHub Issues are items you can create in a repository to plan, discuss and track work.

	Issues are simple to create and flexible to suit a variety of scenarios. You can use issues to track work, give or receive feedback, collaborate on ideas or tasks, and efficiently communicate with others.

b. What is a pull request?

	A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another. In a pull request, collaborators can review and discuss the proposed set of changes before they integrate the changes into the main codebase. Pull requests display the differences, or diffs, between the content in the source branch and the content in the target branch.

c. How do I open up a pull request?

	You can create pull requests on GitHub.com by using a Web browser.

	If you want to create a new branch for your pull request and do not have write permissions to the repository, you can fork the repository first.

	You can specify which branch you'd like to merge your changes into when you create your pull request. Pull requests can only be opened between two branches that are different. When thinking about branches, remember that the base branch is *where* changes should be applied, the head branch contains *what* you would like to be applied.

	Steps:
	1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
	1. In the "Branch" menu, choose the branch that contains your commits.
	1. Above the list of files, in the yellow banner, click Compare & pull request to create a pull request for the associated branch.
	1. Use the base branch dropdown menu to select the branch you'd like to merge your changes into, then use the compare branch drop-down menu to choose the topic branch you made your changes in.
	1. Type a title and description for your pull request.
	1. To create a pull request that is ready for review, click Create Pull Request. To create a draft pull request, use the drop-down and select Create Draft Pull Request, then click Draft Pull Request. If you are the member of an organization, you may need to request access to draft pull requests from an organization owner.
